ng generate

Generates and/or modifies files based on a schematic.

Commands:
  ng generate <schematic>              Run the provided schematic.                                                        [default]
  ng generate ai-config                Generates AI configuration files for Angular projects. This schematic creates configuration
                                       files that help AI tools follow Angular best practices, improving the quality of
                                       AI-generated code and suggestions.
  ng generate app-shell                Configures your project to generate an app-shell during build time.
  ng generate application [name]       Generates a new Angular application within your workspace. This schematic sets up the
                                       foundational structure of your project, including the root component, module, and
                                       configuration files. You can customize various aspects of the application, such as routing,
                                       styling, and testing.                                                         [aliases: app]
  ng generate class [name]             Creates a new class in your project. Classes are the fundamental building blocks for
                                       object-oriented programming in TypeScript. They provide a blueprint for creating objects
                                       with properties and methods. This schematic helps you generate a new class with the basic
                                       structure and optional test files.                                             [aliases: cl]
  ng generate component [name]         Creates a new Angular component. Components are the basic building blocks of Angular
                                       applications. Each component consists of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and an
                                       optional CSS stylesheet. Use this schematic to generate a new component in your project.
                                                                                                                       [aliases: c]
  ng generate config [type]            Generates configuration files for your project. These files control various aspects of your
                                       project's build process, testing, and browser compatibility. This schematic helps you create
                                       or update essential configuration files with ease.
  ng generate directive [name]         Creates a new directive in your project. Directives are used to extend the behavior or
                                       appearance of HTML elements and components. They allow you to manipulate the DOM, add custom
                                       attributes, and respond to events. This schematic generates the necessary files and
                                       boilerplate code for a new directive.                                           [aliases: d]
  ng generate enum [name]              Creates a new enum in your project. Enums (enumerations) are a way to define a set of named
                                       constants, making your code more readable and maintainable. This schematic generates a new
                                       enum with the specified name and type.                                          [aliases: e]
  ng generate environments             Generates and configures environment files for your project. Environment files allow you to
                                       define different settings and configurations for various environments, such as development,
                                       testing, and production. This schematic helps you create and manage these files, making it
                                       easier to customize your application's behavior for each environment.
  ng generate guard [name]             Creates a new route guard in your project. Route guards are used to control access to parts
                                       of your application by checking certain conditions before a route is activated. This
                                       schematic generates a new guard with the specified name, type, and options.     [aliases: g]
  ng generate interceptor [name]       Creates a new interceptor in your project. Interceptors are used to intercept and modify
                                       HTTP requests and responses before they reach their destination. This allows you to perform
                                       tasks like adding authentication headers, handling errors, or logging requests. This
                                       schematic generates the necessary files and boilerplate code for a new interceptor.
  ng generate interface [name] [type]  Creates a new interface in your project. Interfaces define the structure of objects in
                                       TypeScript, ensuring type safety and code clarity. This schematic generates a new interface
                                       with the specified name and type.                                               [aliases: i]
  ng generate library [name]           Creates a new library project in your Angular workspace. Libraries are reusable collections
                                       of components, services, and other Angular artifacts that can be shared across multiple
                                       applications. This schematic simplifies the process of generating a new library with the
                                       necessary files and configurations.                                           [aliases: lib]
  ng generate module [name]            Creates a new, generic NgModule definition in the given project.                [aliases: m]
  ng generate pipe [name]              Creates a new pipe in your project. Pipes are used to transform data for display in
                                       templates. They take input values and apply a specific transformation, such as formatting
                                       dates, currency, or filtering arrays. This schematic generates the necessary files and
                                       boilerplate code for a new pipe.                                                [aliases: p]
  ng generate resolver [name]          Creates a new resolver in your project. Resolvers are used to pre-fetch data before a route
                                       is activated, ensuring that the necessary data is available before the component is
                                       displayed. This can improve the user experience by preventing delays and loading states.
                                       This schematic generates a new resolver with the specified name and options.    [aliases: r]
  ng generate service [name]           Creates a new service in your project. Services are used to encapsulate reusable logic, such
                                       as data access, API calls, or utility functions. This schematic simplifies the process of
                                       generating a new service with the necessary files and boilerplate code.         [aliases: s]
  ng generate service-worker           Adds a service worker to your project. Service workers enable your application to work
                                       offline or on low-quality networks by caching assets and intercepting network requests. This
                                       schematic configures your project to use a service worker.
  ng generate web-worker [name]        Creates a new web worker in your project. Web workers allow you to run JavaScript code in
                                       the background, improving the performance and responsiveness of your application by
                                       offloading computationally intensive tasks. This schematic generates the necessary files for
                                       a new web worker and provides an optional code snippet to demonstrate its usage.

Arguments:
  schematic  The [collection:schematic] to run.                                                                            [string]

Options:
      --help         Shows a help message for this command in the console.                                                [boolean]
      --interactive  Enable interactive input prompts.                                                    [boolean] [default: true]
  -d, --dry-run      Run through and reports activity without writing out results.                       [boolean] [default: false]
      --defaults     Disable interactive input prompts for options with a default.                       [boolean] [default: false]
      --force        Force overwriting of existing files.                                                [boolean] [default: false]
